# Google Apps Scripts

This repo collects some of my Google Apps Scripts (generally for Gmail or Calendar) authored over the years.  They are
organized by a couple separate accounts I use (personal/cons).  Scripts in here should be reasonably tidy and suitable
for public consumption, security-wise.

Scripts:
- cons/gmail scripts - At present, this contains fxnality to auto-expire marketing emails, based on labels
- personal/gmail snooze - this is a script that implements snooze in Gmail, though that's a native feature now, so this
  isn't terribly useful now.
- personal/invoice template merge - script to merge a spreadsheet of data with a doc template, to auto-generate invoices 
  per row of data.
- personal/ooo calendar syncer - script to collect OOO events from an org's members' calendars and post to a shared 
  calendar
